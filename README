jn 0.3
by Ben Winston (winsbe01@gmail.com)

A simple command-line journal tool.

REQUIREMENTS:
 - less
 - sed
 - any text editor

TO INSTALL:
 - run the jninstaller script and follow the on-screen instructions
	you@your-machine~$ ./jninstaller
 - re-source your .bashrc file to make sure everything got set up correctly
	you@your-machine~$ source .bashrc

TO RUN:
 - run 'jn' or 'jn -u' and you will be brought into the editor you chose to make your entry
	you@your-machine~$ jn
 - for help, type 'jn -h'
 - to browse the whole journal, type 'jn -b'

CHANGELOG:
 - added browsing feature to view the entire journal
 - now using a user-chosen editor to fill out the journal, instead of reading from stdin
 - removed a "search" feature -> will be implemented in a future version, but the first version was too simplistic to be useful

TODO:
 - add a more thorough search feature (i.e. will print out the entire paragraph or entry that a search term/phrase appears in)
 - add a date search (give it any of a month, day, etc. and the matching entries will be printed)
 - figure out how to get it so new installs won't have to run 'source .bashrc'
